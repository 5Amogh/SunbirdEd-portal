        <h3>3. SunBird’S PRINCIPLES TO PROTECT PRIVACY</h3>

        <p>We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and secure and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails and other communications you send to us through our Website are not encrypted.
In order to protect your privacy, SunBird has adopted the following principles:</p>

        <p>a) Security</p>

        <p>b) Choice</p>

        <p>c) Notice</p>

        <p>d) Access/Accuracy</p>

        <h4>a) Security </h4>

        <p>Wherever your Personal Information may be held within SunBird, the company intends to take reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 
We care about the security of user. While we work to protect the security of your account and related information, SunBird cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures. Please notify us immediately of any compromise or unauthorized use of your account by emailing privacy@SunBird.com.</p>

        <p>Where SunBird collects Personal Information on the Website, SunBird intends to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether SunBird plans to share such Personal Information outside of SunBird or with those working on SunBird's behalf. Unless the transfer of Personal Information is legally required, SunBird does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your permission to third parties who are not bound to act on SunBird's behalf.</p>

        <h4>d) Access/Accuracy</h4>
